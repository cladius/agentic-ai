# Goal

A simple demonstration using Python + Langflow to showcase how we can combine traditional programming with GenAI to provide a better user experience.

## Langflow Changes

Modify the prompt to ensure Structured Ouput is returned which can be programmatically parsed by the Python code [quiz.py](https://github.com/cladius/agentic-ai/blob/master/langflow/Misc/quiz_cli/quiz.py)

```
{context}

---

Given the context above, generate a MCQ quiz with 10 questions and 4 options for each question. The questions should be about the topic {question} There should be exactly one correct answer for each question. Provide the answer key at the bottom.

Send this as a JSON schema. Return only the JSON schema. The JSON schema should be made up of an array of objects. Each object should have the following fields - question, options (as an Array) and correct_answer (as an integer from 0 to 3).
```

Generate the Langflow API key via the steps mentioned [here](https://docs.langflow.org/api-keys-and-authentication#create-a-langflow-api-key).

Run the actual curl command for the workflow via Workflow > Share > API Access > cURL

## Claude.AI Prompt

You can create a simple Python application to invoke the Langflow API and provide a cli-based quiz experience for the user OR use [Claude](https://claude.ai) to generate it for you.

  <summary><b>Sample Prompt</b></summary>
what's the easiest way to have a CLI python appn that will invoke my langflow api endpoint running locally to create a 10 question MCQ and give me a score. 

The curl request is curl --request POST \
     --url 'http://localhost:7860/api/v1/run/973c0769-772b-4036-9c9f-29bb272ea4f3?stream=false' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header "x-api-key: $LANGFLOW_API_KEY" \
     --data '{
                   "output_type": "chat",
