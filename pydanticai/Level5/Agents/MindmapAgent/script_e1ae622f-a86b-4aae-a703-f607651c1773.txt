PydanticAI is a Python agent framework designed to simplify the development of production-grade applications using Generative AI. Built by the Pydantic team, it aims to bring the ease of use of FastAPI to GenAI app development. Key features include model-agnostic support for various LLMs like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini, seamless integration with Pydantic Logfire for real-time debugging and monitoring, and a type-safe, Python-centric design.

The framework leverages Python's control flow and offers structured responses through Pydantic validation. It also provides an optional dependency injection system for providing data and services to agents, facilitating testing and iterative development. PydanticAI supports streamed responses with immediate validation and graph support for complex applications. Example use cases include building a bank support agent with tools for customer balance inquiries and card management, showcasing dependency injection and structured output. The documentation is available in llms.txt format.
