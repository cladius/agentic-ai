# ü§ñ Programming Concepts Tutor using Google ADK + Gemini

This project is a Python-based CLI application that leverages **Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)** and the **Gemini `gemini-2.0-flash` model** to create an interactive AI tutor. The agent is designed to provide **beginner-friendly explanations** of fundamental programming concepts such as:

* ‚úÖ Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
* ‚úÖ Functions
* ‚úÖ Variables
* ‚úÖ Loops
* ‚úÖ Data Structures
* ‚úÖ Algorithms

Each query is handled **independently (stateless)** to ensure fresh and concise responses, with no conversation memory.

## ‚ú® Features

* üßë‚Äçüéì **Beginner-Friendly Explanations**
  Clear and simple answers designed for users new to programming.

* üí¨ **Interactive Command-Line Interface**
  Ask questions via CLI and get instant AI-powered answers.

* üß† **Stateless Design**
  Each question is processed in isolation‚Äîno prior context is remembered.

* üîí **Secure Configuration**
  API keys and sensitive values are stored in a `.env` file.

* ‚ö° **Lightweight Setup**
  No external tools or retrievers‚Äîjust pure agent response.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure you have:

* üêç **Python 3.8+**
* üåê **Google API Key** for accessing Gemini via `google-genai`
* üß† **Google ADK** installed

---

## üì¶ Dependencies

Install these Python packages:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv google-adk google-generativeai
```

**Used Packages:**

* `python-dotenv` ‚Äì Load environment variables securely
* `google-adk` ‚Äì Agent + session handling
* `google-generativeai` ‚Äì Access Gemini model (`gemini-2.0-flash`)

---

## üîê Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit your API key to version control!

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application:

```bash
python main.py
```

### üí¨ Interact with the Agent:

You'll see a prompt like:

```
You:
```

Ask a question, for example:

* `What is a function?`
* `What is OOPS in programming?`

To exit the conversation, type:

```bash
exit
```
