# Career Advisor Agent 🌟


## Overview 📖


Welcome to the Career Advisor Agent! This Python-based application leverages Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) to create a conversational AI that guides users through career exploration. Powered by the gemini-2.0-flash model, the agent remembers user details (like name, interests, and background) to provide personalized career advice, recommend specific textbooks, and suggest job roles. It's like having a career counselor in your terminal! 🚀

## Usage 🚀

Run the Application:


python main.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interact with the Agent:

The program prompts with You: .


Introduce yourself (e.g., "Hi, I'm Alice, interested in compiler design and ML") and ask about career options.


Follow up with questions like "What textbooks should I read?" or "What job roles suit me?".


Type exit to quit.


Example Interaction:
Career Advisor Agent is running. Type 'exit' to quit.


Introduce yourself and ask about career options!


--- Example conversation: ---
You could tell the agent about yourself and ask 'What are some good career options?'


Then follow up with: 'What are some relevant textbooks that align with my interests?'


--- End example ---

You: Hi, I'm Alice, interested in compiler design and ML.


>>> You: Hi, I'm Alice, interested in compiler design and ML.
>>>
>>> 
<<< Agent: Nice to meet you, Alice! Your interests in compiler design and machine learning open up exciting career paths. For compiler design, you could explore roles like Compiler Engineer or Systems Software Developer. For ML, consider Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist. Would you like specific job role details or learning resources to get started?
You: What textbooks should I read?


>>> You: What textbooks should I read?
>>>
>>> 
<<< Agent: For compiler design, Alice, I recommend *Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools* by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman—it's the 'Dragon Book' and a classic for understanding compiler construction. For ML, *Deep Learning* by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville is great for diving into neural networks, which aligns with your interests. Want more resources or details on these?
You: exit


Goodbye!
