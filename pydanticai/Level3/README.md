# üîç Level 3 ‚Äì AI Assistant with Real-Time Web Search

## Overview

Implements a **tool-augmented AI agent** using the `pydantic-ai` framework. The agent answers user queries with real-time, web-sourced data using the `Tavily` search tool

## üéØ Objective

Build an agent that:
- Integrates external tools (web search),
- Synthesizes relevant search results into coherent answers,
- Returns **only** the answer (not a raw list of links),
- Includes **credible sources** for user verification.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Python** (async-based CLI app)
- **Pydantic AI** ‚Äì Agent framework
- **Tavily Search API** ‚Äì Real-time web search
- **OpenAI GPT-4o** ‚Äì For language generation
- **Logfire** ‚Äì For observability and debugging
- **dotenv** ‚Äì For secure key management


## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

-  User asks a question via CLI.
-  `Tavily` search tool is triggered for queries needing real-world data.
-  GPT-4o agent processes the search result and composes an answer.
-  Sources are listed at the bottom as a **numbered list of URLs**.
-  Logs and spans are sent to `Logfire` for each query-response pair.
