Internship Program - Persistent Systems

---

## Level 1: Basic Agent – Hello World

- **Goal**: Build a simple agent powered by an LLM with no tools or memory.
- **Interaction**:

## Level 2: Conversational Memory

- **Goal**: Integrate memory into the agent for context-aware conversations.
- **Features**:
- Maintain and recall user-specific details.
- Provide relevant answers based on previous messages.

## Level 3: Tools – Web Search Integration

- **Goal**: Enable the agent to call external tools (e.g., Google Search) for real-time information retrieval.
- **Features**:
- Search and return synthesized, relevant answers (not just links).

- ## Level 4: Vector Store + Advanced Tool Use

- **Goal**: Implement persistent knowledge via vector databases and support tool-chaining.
- **Features**:
- Ingest textbooks, resumes, and documents into a vector store.
- Support structured extraction (e.g., AIR, CGPA from resumes).
- Integrate OCR for reading scanned documents.
- Enable agent-to-tool orchestration.

- ## Level 5: NotebookLM Mimic – Research Agent

- **Goal**: Build a multi-agent, multi-tool environment capable of deep research and summarization.
- **Features**:
- Ingest and process large information dumps (PDFs, YouTube, web pages, raw text).
- Summarize, mind-map, and generate notes or podcasts.
- **Sample Use Cases**:
- Create a mind map of compiler design challenges.
- Generate a podcast script on AI trends in compiler optimization.
